    Lua-TTyrant

    TokyoTyrant API for Lua.
    Copyright (C)2010 by Valeriu Palos. All rights reserved.

--- Description ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Lua-ttyrant is a binding to the C API of the TokyoTyrant server (visit http://fallabs.com/) for the Lua
    programming language. I have seen several attempts on the net to build a TokyoTyrant library straight in
    Lua (implementing the tyrant/memcache protocol) but I feel that is an unnatural approach since Lua was
    especially designed to work *with* C and not to avoid it. Further more, by using the actual TokyoTyrant C
    API library this implementation is less likely to produce protocol errors or inconsistencies.

    The goal of lua-ttyrant is to be a stable, binary-safe and complete binding of the TokyoTyrant C API
    for both Lua and LuaJIT. At the time of this writing TokyoTyrant 1.1.41 was used as the reference API.

--- Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To compile lua-ttyrant you will need the following progams compiled/installed on your system:

    1. GCC
    2. TokyoTyrant
    3. lua 5.1
    4. luarocks

    On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems you can install all of these by issuing the following command:

       $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libtokyotyrant-dev lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev luarocks

--- Install/Test ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The recommended way to install Lua-TTyrant is via the LuaRocks system:

    $ luarocks install lua-ttyrant
    
    However, as an alternative, you can do it manually like this:
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/valeriupalos/lua-ttyrant
    $ cd lua-ttyrant
    $ luarocks make
    
    If you want to install it system-wide just run the last command as root (i.e. sudo luarocks make).

    To run the set of tests you will first have to start two instances of ttserver: one for a regular (hash)
    database (on port 1978) and another for a table database (on port 1979), then run the test.lua script:

    $ ttserver -port 1978 /tmp/test.tch &
    $ ttserver -port 1979 /tmp/test.tct &
    $ lua test/test.lua

    At the end you can stop the tyrant instances and delete the generated files like this:

    $ killall ttserver
    $ rm -rf /tmp/test.*

--- Documentation --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The lua-ttyrant library is a *binding* which means that it actually "transports" the functions provided
    by the original C API into the Lua language. Therefore you only need to consult two resources in order to
    use it:

    1. The TokyoTyrant API reference (http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/spex.html).
    2. The 'ttyrant-test.lua' file which contains test cases for every implemented API function.

    There are however, as the tests show, a few differences from the original API. These are outlined below:

    --> The functions tcrdbecode() and tcrdberrmsg() are not present in the binding; instead all functions
        that can fail, will return <nil, 'error string'> on failure (as is the usual for Lua).

    --> The functionality usually provided in C by the tcrdbmisc() function (i.e. bulk operations) is merged
        straight in the get(), put() and out() methods of the ttyrant class, all of which can act on a whole
        set of keys/values, given as a table or a list (see the test cases for examples).

    --> The function variants ending in '2' (for strings) make no sense in Lua since the values are always
        implicitly converted into strings.

    --> Since Lua make no difference between integers and doubles, the functions tcrdbaddint() and
        tcrdbadddouble() are merged into the function(s) ttyrant:increment() and ttyrant.table:increment().

    --> Some functions were only used internally (e.g. tcrdbqryrescols()) since they have no meaning for Lua.

--- Changes --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * 2012-02-18:
    
      - The keys() iterator function is depreciated in favor of iterator().
      - The ttyrant:open() function has moved in the ttyrant.hash namespace (to match ttyrant.table).
      - Passing a table of values to the open() functions is now depreciated; use either of:
          - open("localhost:1978")
          - open("localhost", 1978)
      - Query objects are now garbage collected (the delete() method is now a noop).
      - Query methods search_get, search_out, search_count are depreciated in favor of 
        searchget, searchout, searchcount.
        
    For now all changes are backward-compatible (i.e. previous variants still work but are depreciated).

--- Status ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The library is *almost* complete meaning that there are several functions which are not yet implemented;
    The library is to be considered in *beta* state, though it is already quite stable, being actually used 
    in production environments for more than a year. If you require some (or all) of the functions below that
    are not yet implemented, please either contribute some code or *ask* me to do it and I'll try to oblige.
    
    Also unfortunately I had no time *yet* to write a documentation; for now just skim over the statements
    in test.lua for usage examples (they should be self-explanatory). You may also check the TokyoTyrant help
    (http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/spex.html).

    Functions not yet supported (they are removed from this list as they are implemented):

    - tcrdbrestore()
    - tcrdbget3()
    - tcrdboptimize()
    - tcrdbsetmst()/tcrdbsetmst2()
    - tcrdbtblgenuid()
    - tcrdbqryhint()
    - tcrdbmetasearch()
    - tcrdbparasearch()
    - tcrdbext()
