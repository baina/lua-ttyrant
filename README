    LUA-TTYRANT:
    A Lua binding to the C API of the TokyoTyrant storage server.
    Written by Valeriu Paloş (Copyright 2010).

--- Description ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lua-ttyrant is a binding to the C API of the TokyoTyrant server (visit http://fallabs.com/) for the Lua
programming language. I have seen several attempts on the net to build a TokyoTyrant library straight in Lua
(implementing the protocol) but I feel that is error prone and rather unnatural since Lua is especially
designed to work *with* C and not to avoid it. Further more, by using the actual TokyoTyrant C API library
this implementation is far less likely to make protocol mistakes or to fall behind any upgrades made by
Mikio Hirabayashi (the TokyoTyrant creator). It is also a bit faster :).
